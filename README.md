# Blind-Valley
This Python script implements a backtracking algorithm to solve a grid-based puzzle involving H and B plugs. The puzzle grid is defined by an input file specifying row and column constraints, along with directional guides (L, R, U, D) for placement.

Features
- Reads puzzle configuration from a text file.
- Validates plug placements according to the given constraints.
- Uses backtracking to attempt all possible placements.
- Writes the solution to an output file, or indicates when no solution exists.
